# Abstract for Digital Narrative

## Topics

The topic of my digital narrative will be the Open Source movement. My central question will be: How has the Open movement changed my life and the world?  

## Primary Sources

I will analyze and compare primary source documents like “GNU Manifesto” by Richard Stallman, “Declaration of Independence”, and “Cathedral and the Bazaar” by Eric S. Raymond. In addition to these founding documents of the Open Source movement, I will take a look at statistics of the price of information access (textbook and academic journal prices), the price and service of proprietary software, and the number of keywords covered by traditional encyclopedias like Encyclopedia Britannica. I will also talk about famous and widely used open source licenses like the MIT license, the GNU public license, and the copyleft movement against rigid controls of the copyright law. I may also use the editing histories of some typical Wikipedia articles. In addition, I will be analyzing popularity statistics of open source projects like Linux, Android, Chromium, Apache, and LibreOffice.

## Secondary sources

Next, for secondary sources, I will be using *Good faith collaboration: the culture of Wikipedia* written by Joseph M. Reagle Jr. In addition, I will also be looking at the role of the Creative Commons license in art and education. My key terms will include “open source”, “contribution”, “open education”, “open education”, “open art and culture”, “open science”.
