Main article: [List of free and open-source software packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_and_open-source_software_packages)

Open source software projects are built and maintained by a network of volunteer programmers and are widely used in free as well as commercial products.[[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software#cite_note-Popp2-36) Prime examples of open-source products are the [Apache HTTP Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server), the e-commerce platform [osCommerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OsCommerce), internet browsers [Mozilla Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox) and [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser))(the project where the vast majority of development of the freeware [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) is done) and the full office suite [LibreOffice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice). One of the most successful open-source products is the [GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) operating system, an open-source [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like)operating system, and its derivative [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), an operating system for mobile devices.[[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software#cite_note-87)[[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software#cite_note-88) In some industries, open source software is the norm.[[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software#cite_note-Noyes16-89)

### [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)

Linux is the leading operating system on [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) and other [big iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_iron_(computing)) systems such as [mainframe computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer), and the only OS used on [TOP500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500) [supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) (since November 2017, having gradually eliminated all competitors).[[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-23)[[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-24)[[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-rules_supercomputers-25) It is used by around 2.3 percent of [desktop computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer).[[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-Netmarketshare.com-26)[[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-27) The [Chromebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook), which runs the Linux kernel-based [Chrome OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS), dominates the US [K–12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K–12) education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 [notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop) sales in the US.[[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-28)

Linux also runs on [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system), i.e. devices whose [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) is typically built into the [firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware) and is highly tailored to the system. This includes [routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)), [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation)controls, [televisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television),[[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-29)[[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-30) [digital video recorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder), [video game consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console), and [smartwatches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch).[[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-LinuxDevices-31) Many smartphones and [tablet computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer) run [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) and other Linux derivatives.[[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-32) Because of the dominance of Android on [smartphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone), Linux has the [largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems)[installed base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installed_base) of all [general-purpose operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_operating_system).[[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#cite_note-marketshare.hitslink.com-33)

#### Wikipedia

[![wikipedia](https://d15omoko64skxi.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wikipedia.png)](https://www.wikipedia.org/)Wikipedia migrated its licensing structure from the GNU Free Documentation License to a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. The world’s largest and most cited collaborative encyclopedia made this move via a community vote and for good reason. By changing to a CC BY-SA license, Wikipedia (and the entire collection of Wikimedia sites) allows content to legally flow in and out of the site with ease, enabling one of the great cultural resources of the digital revolution to legally interact with an endless array of similar cultural institutions.

#### flickr

[![flickr](https://d15omoko64skxi.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flickr.png)](https://www.flickr.com/)Flickr was one of the first major online communities to incorporate Creative Commons licensing options into its user interface, giving photographers around the world the easy ability to share photos on terms of their choosing. As the Flickr community grew, so did the number of CC-licensed images — currently there are well over 100 million on the site — establishing Flickr as the Web’s single largest source of CC-licensed content. Flickr’s services have grown to include a CC image portal and advanced CC search features, making the site one of world’s most useful resources for discovering creativity that is available for free and legal sharing, use, and remixing.
